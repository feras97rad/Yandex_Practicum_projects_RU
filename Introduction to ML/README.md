**Project Description**\
The mobile operator "..." found out: many customers use archive tariffs. They want to build a system capable of analyzing customer behavior and offering users a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra".\
You have at your disposal data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs. You need to build a model for the classification task that will choose the appropriate tariff. You won't need data preprocessing â€” you've already done it.\
Build a model with the maximum accuracy value. To pass the project successfully, you need to bring the proportion of correct answers to at least 0.75. Check accuracy on the test sample yourself.\
\
**Task**\
Build Machine Learning model for the classification problem, which finds a suitable tariff. (binary classification "Smart"/"Ultra")\
\
**Tools used**\
Python, Pandas, descriptive statistics, Seaborn, sklearn,linear models, ensemble models
