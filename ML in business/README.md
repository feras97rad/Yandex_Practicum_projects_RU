**Project Description**\
Let's say you work for a mining company "...". You need to decide where to drill a new well.\
The steps for choosing a location are usually as follows:\
In the selected region, characteristics for wells are collected: the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves;\
A model is being built to predict the volume of reserves in new wells;\
Choose wells with the highest value estimates;\
Determine the region with the maximum total profit of the selected wells.\
You have been provided with oil samples in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known.\
\
**Task**\
Build a model to determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. Analyze the possible profits and risks with the Bootstrap technique.\
\
**Tools used**\
Python, Pandas, sklearn, math, numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Bootstrap, Machine Learning
