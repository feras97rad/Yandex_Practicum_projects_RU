**Project description**\
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for "...". The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises.\
The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.\
You need to:\
Prepare the data;\
Conduct a research analysis of the data;\
Build and train a model.\
To complete the project, refer to the pandas, matplotlib and sklearn libraries. Their documentation will help you.\
The next lesson is devoted to the technological process of ore purification. Decide for yourself which parts are needed to build the model and which are not.\
Some parameters are not available because they are measured and/or calculated much later. Because of this, the test sample lacks some features that may be in the training. Also, there are no target features in the test set.\
The source dataset contains training and test samples with all the features.\
You have raw data at your disposal: they were simply unloaded from the storage. Before you start building a model, check them for correctness according to our instructions.\
\
**Task**\
The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore. At your disposal is data with the parameters of extraction and purification.\
\
**Tools used**\
Python, Pandas, SK-learn, numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Machine Learning
