The comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. For example:
 * Moscow is a megapolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
 * St. Petersburg is a cultural capital, with its own tastes.

On Yandex Music data, you will compare the behavior of users of the two capitals.

**Research objective** — test three hypotheses:
1. User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg, this manifests itself in different ways.
2. On Monday morning, some genres prevail in Moscow, and others in St. Petersburg. Similarly, on Friday evening, different genres prevail — depending on the city. 
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, pop music is more often listened to, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.

**Progress of the study**

You will get data about user behavior from the file `yandex_music_project.csv'. Nothing is known about the quality of the data. Therefore, a review of the data will be needed before testing hypotheses. 

You will check the data for errors and evaluate their impact on the study. Then, at the preprocessing stage, you will look for an opportunity to correct the most critical data errors.
 
Thus, the study will take place in three stages:
 1. Data overview.
 2. Data preprocessing.
 3. Hypothesis testing.
