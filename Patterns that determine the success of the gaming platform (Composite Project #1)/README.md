You work in the online store "...", which sells computer games all over the world.

Here is the data up to 2016. Let's imagine that it's December 2016, and you're planning a campaign for 2017. We need to work out the principle of working with data. It doesn't matter if you forecast sales for 2017 according to 2016 data or 2027 according to 2026 data.\
The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), an association that determines the age rating of computer games. ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it a suitable age category, for example, "For adults", "For younger children" or "For teenagers".\
