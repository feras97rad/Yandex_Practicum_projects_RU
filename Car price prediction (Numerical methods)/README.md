**Project Description**\
The service for the sale of used cars "..." is developing an application to attract new customers. It will be possible to find out the market value of your car. 
Instructions for the implementation of the project.\
To strengthen the study, do not limit yourself to gradient boosting. Try simpler models â€” sometimes they work better. These rare cases are easy to miss if you always use only boosting.\
Experiment and compare the characteristics of the models: training time, prediction time, accuracy of the result.\
\
**Task**\
Build a model that knows how to determine the cost of the car. At your disposal are data on the technical characteristics, configuration and prices of other cars.\
Criteria that are important to the customer:\
prediction quality;\
model training time;\
the prediction time of the model.\
\
**Tools used**\
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Math, SciPy, SK-learn, tqdm, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM
